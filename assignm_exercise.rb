=begin
In one Ruby file, write code to solve the problems below. Your code 
should print out each problem statement, followed by the output from 
the conditional statement(s).

(1) Prompt for a number. If the number is greater than 70, print PASSING; 
otherwise, print NOT PASSING.
(2) Prompt for a string. If the string is equal to green, print GO, 
otherwise, print STOP.
(3)Prompt for a number. If the number is even, print EVEN, otherwise, 
print ODD.
(4)Prompt for a number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print
MULTIPLE OF 5, otherwise, print NOT A MULTIPLE OF 5.
(5) Prompt for a number. If the number is less than 10, print ONE DIGIT.
If the number is 100 or greater, print THREE DIGITS, otherwise print TWO DIGITS.
(6) Prompt for a jersey number. If that number is 12, 71, or 80, print That
number is retired from the Seattle Seahawks!, otherwise do nothing.
(7) Prompt for a state. If the state is Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, print This
state is in the PNW, otherwise print You should move to the PNW; it’s great 
here!
(8) Prompt for a one of the following: SHORT, TALL, GRANDE, VENTI. Print out the
number of ounces that drink includes (8, 12, 16, 20 respectively).
(9) Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay. Provide 
time-and-a-half for hours worked beyond 40 (e.g., if you get paid $10/hr and 
work 45 hours in a week, you would gross $475 (40 x 10 + 5 x 15).
(10) Rewrite the solution to the previous problem adding this modification: do 
not process any employee if their hours worked is greater than 60, instead 
display the message Please see manager.
